# hello-world
I'm new to the tech world, aside from some elementary knowledge working with HTML/CSS for my neopets webpages. 0-0; With that said, I'm currently teaching myself how to code again, and very interested in UI/UX design in addition to programming. Hoping to be a part of this wonderful community and work on developing some projects together in the future!
